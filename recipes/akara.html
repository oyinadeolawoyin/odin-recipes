        <h3>Tips For Making The Best AKARA (KOOSE)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Blend the beans with very little water, too much water would result in flat or no akara (hahaha)</li>
            <li>Incorporate air into the bean batter before frying using a whisk or wooden spoon</li>
            <li>Regulate the hotness of the oil when frying. If the oil is too hot, it will burn the bean fritters and may result in false cooking which will make the inside undercooked</li>
        </ol>
